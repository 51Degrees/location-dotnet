<h2>Example</h2>

<div id="content">
    <p>
        The following values are determined sever-side on the first request.
        As the server has no location information to work from, these 
        values will all be unknown:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Country</strong></dt>
        <dv>@(country.HasValue ? country.Value : $"Unknown ({country.NoValueMessage})")</dv>
        <dt><strong>State</strong></dt>
        <dv>@(state.HasValue ? state.Value : $"Unknown ({state.NoValueMessage})")</dv>
        <dt><strong>County</strong></dt>
        <dv>@(county.HasValue ? county.Value : $"Unknown ({county.NoValueMessage})")</dv>
        <dt><strong>Town/City</strong></dt>
        <dv>@(town.HasValue ? town.Value : $"Unknown ({town.NoValueMessage})")</dv>
    </dl>
    <p>
        When the button below is clicked, JavaScript running on the client-side will be used to obtain additional evidence (i.e. the location information from the device). If no additional information appears then it may indicate an external problem such as JavaScript being disabled in your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the accuracy of the information is dependent on the accuracy of the location data returned by your device. Any device that lacks GPS is likely to return a highly inaccurate result. Among devices with GPS, some have a significantly lower margin of error than others.
    </p>

        // The sequence is:
        // 1. Response contains JavaScript property 'JavaScript'. This is not executed immediately on the client as it will prompt the user to allow access to location.
        // 2. When the button is clicked, the fod.complete function is called, passing 'location' as the second parameter. This lets the code know that we want to execute
        // any JavaScript needed to obtain the location data that is needed to determine the user's postal address details.
        // 3. The execution of the location JavaScript triggers a background callback to the webserver that includes the new evidence (i.e. lat/lon).
        // 4. The web server responds with new JSON data that contains the updated property values based on the new evidence.
        // 5. The JavaScript integrates the new JSON data and fires the 'complete' callback function below, which then displays the results.
