/// Getting started example of using 51Degrees reverse geocoding.
/// 
/// This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/location-dotnet/blob/master/FiftyOne.GeoLocation/Examples/Cloud/GettingStarted/Program.cs). 
/// 
/// To run this example, you will need to create a **resource key**. 
/// The resource key is used as short-hand to store the particular set of 
/// properties you are interested in as well as any associated license keys 
/// that entitle you to increased request limits and/or paid-for properties.
/// 
/// You can create a resource key using the 51Degrees [Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com).
/// 
/// Required NuGet Dependencies:
/// - FiftyOne.GeoLocation
/// 
/// The example shows how to:
/// 
/// 1. Build a new Pipeline with a cloud-based geolocation engine, with lazy
/// loading configured to allow up to a second for a response from the cloud
/// service.
/// 2. Create a new FlowData instance ready to be populated with evidence for
/// the Pipeline.
/// 3. Process a longitude and latitude to retrieve the values associated with
/// with the location for the selected properties.
/// 4. Extract the value of a property as a string from the results.
